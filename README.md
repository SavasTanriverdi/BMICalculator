## Key Features:
- Take user's weight and height as input
- Calculate BMI based on the formula: BMI = weight (kg) / (height (m) * height (m))
- Display the BMI value and corresponding health category
- Handle different weight and height inputs from the user

## Usage:
Run the main class and input your weight (in kilograms) and height (in meters). The program will calculate and display your BMI along with your health status.
